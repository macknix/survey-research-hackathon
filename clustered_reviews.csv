Hotel Arena, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer , Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful ,5
Hotel Arena,, No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,0
Hotel Arena, Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge , Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back ,0
Hotel Arena, My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep , Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character ,5
Hotel Arena, You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again , Amazing location and building Romantic setting ,0
Hotel Arena, Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars , Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs ,0
Hotel Arena, Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it , The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park ,1
Hotel Arena, Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good, Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast ,4
Hotel Arena, Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time,,5
Hotel Arena, The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night , The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling ,0
Hotel Arena, Nothing all great , Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,0
Hotel Arena, 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 , Style location rooms,5
Hotel Arena, The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast , Comfy bed good location ,5
Hotel Arena,, This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return ,0
Hotel Arena, The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him , It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it ,0
Hotel Arena,, This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good ,0
Hotel Arena, Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse, Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic ,2
Hotel Arena, We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment , We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,4
Hotel Arena,, Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,3
Hotel Arena, We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely , I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee ,0
Hotel Arena, Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit , Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area ,1
Hotel Arena, Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery , The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,5
Hotel Arena, Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing , The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable ,3
Hotel Arena, Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner , Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ,2
Hotel Arena, Nothing , Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning ,0
Hotel Arena, The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv , Great location in the park near museums and restaurants Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms Big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m,3
Hotel Arena, Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all , The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around ,0
Hotel Arena, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you , Great hotel original concept style,0
Hotel Arena, We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom , The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ,0
Hotel Arena, There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical , The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel ,0
Hotel Arena, Little bit on the pricey side, The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning ,0
Hotel Arena, Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective , Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern ,5
Hotel Arena, Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,,3
Hotel Arena, Please see above, The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ,0
Hotel Arena, The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two , The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing,3
Hotel Arena, Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality , Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great ,0
Hotel Arena, not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,5
Hotel Arena, The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more , Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,3
Hotel Arena, the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,0
Hotel Arena, Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet , Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,6
Hotel Arena, Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy , The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything ,0
Hotel Arena, Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate , Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous ,0
Hotel Arena, Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again , Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk ,0
Hotel Arena, Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that , Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back,3
Hotel Arena, The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning , The brunch to purchase in the morning was good ,4
Hotel Arena, Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either , The location of the hotel is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable The room was spacious enough for 2 people ,5
Hotel Arena, The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else , Massive bed,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups , The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in ,0
Hotel Arena,, The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,0
Hotel Arena, Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here, clean and new,1
Hotel Arena, The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam , My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night ,0
Hotel Arena, When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all , The location and views ,1
Hotel Arena, I loved everything , The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat,2
Hotel Arena,, Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly,2
Hotel Arena, when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction, good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction,3
Hotel Arena,, The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend ,0
Hotel Arena, there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night , location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed ,0
Hotel Arena, Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task , Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly ,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference , The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really ,0
Hotel Arena,, Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me ,0
Hotel Arena, The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management , The property is beautiful,0
Hotel Arena, The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor , Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up,3
Hotel Arena, Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again , I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed ,5
Hotel Arena, Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room , Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room,5
Hotel Arena, The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe , The hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park The hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard ,3
Hotel Arena, Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation , Great trip staff very friendly,5
Hotel Arena, Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip , Nice open room Bed plenty of room Bath room clean Fridge was a nice touch Easy to get in and out Staff accommodated us fast and politely,5
Hotel Arena, Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived , To begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise Breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after It has undergone some major renovations since I last stayed there The new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property Super impressed with the Park and the way nature comes together with the hotel New dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing ,0
Hotel Arena, The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass , Beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central ,3
Hotel Arena, Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone , The bath and shower room was amazing Beautiful hotel They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already,3
Hotel Arena, The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price , The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place ,4
Hotel Arena, Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra , The young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful Dinner has been cooked excellent ,4
Hotel Arena, The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive , The location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well ,3
Hotel Arena, upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside , breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added ,5
Hotel Arena, If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast , Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bed,4
Hotel Arena,, The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again ,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction , The location on the park is excellent and very peaceful The restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee ,0
Hotel Arena, Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors , Funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed ,5
Hotel Arena,, Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning ,0
Hotel Arena,, We have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms There are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special Our room 065 was just gorgeous ,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money , The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel ,0
Hotel Arena, I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy , Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room ,0
Hotel Arena, The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel , We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc ,0
Hotel Arena, Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful , The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location ,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy , The restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good breakfast with fresh orange juice WIFI in all hotel,0
Hotel Arena, Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss, Beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms Staff a very helpful and chatty It s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer,0
Hotel Arena, That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel , The bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous ,0
Hotel Arena, Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait , Pretty building interesting rooms ,0
Hotel Arena, No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up , Room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences ,5
Hotel Arena, We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain , rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky,0
Hotel Arena, Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done , Large bed ,0
Hotel Arena, The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere , It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished ,3
Hotel Arena, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair , Good location Cheap ,5
Hotel Arena, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms, Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion ,5
Hotel Arena, There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas , Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast ,3
Hotel Arena, The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate , Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,2
Hotel Arena,, We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds ,1
Hotel Arena, Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout , A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding ,0
Hotel Arena, Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,,3
Hotel Arena, split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing , beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different,5
Hotel Arena, Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud, Location,5
Hotel Arena, Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought, Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll ,0
Hotel Arena, There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant , The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven ,4
Hotel Arena, it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot , super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location I love amsterdam ,0
Hotel Arena, Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle , Staff were brilliant Really helpful attentive and friendly Amazing building with lots of history too ,6
Hotel Arena, Construction during the day though not intrusive, Great Customer Service Staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and Metro passes ,6
Hotel Arena, The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined , The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from ,4
Hotel Arena, No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance, Good water pressure in shower,3
Hotel Arena, There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place , The hotel is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam There are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city Staff were very kind ,5
Hotel Arena, The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious , We upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub ,0
Hotel Arena, there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view, Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful,0
Hotel Arena, Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant , Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,0
Hotel Arena,, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,0
Hotel Arena,, Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night ,4
Hotel Arena,, This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel ,0
Hotel Arena, We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel , Very friendly staff lovely comfy room,0
Hotel Arena, I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 , food recommendations were brilliant,4
Hotel Arena, The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done , The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience ,0
Hotel Arena, the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware , Bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The hotel was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice,3
Hotel Arena, The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough , The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine ,0
Hotel Arena, Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend , Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help ,0
Hotel Arena, The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level ,,1
Hotel Arena, The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small , Well located if you don t mind taking the train ,3
Hotel Arena, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed, this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,0
Hotel Arena, The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central, Liked the staff The location,3
Hotel Arena, Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression , Special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel Relaxed atmosphere Nice restaurant and bar area with terasse Good accessibility of public transport ,0
Hotel Arena, We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick , Room was a great size and comfy bed,1
Hotel Arena, We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back , The staff were lovely and very helpful Bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links ,5
Hotel Arena, The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim , There was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent The snacks in the restaurant were also very good The staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful The bed was comfy ,3
Hotel Arena, We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on , Bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows We stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice Reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful ,0
Hotel Arena, Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space, Very helpful and friendly staff Free WiFi Location and proximity to public transport Provision of iron and board 2 televisions,5
Hotel Arena, There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night , The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside ,3
Hotel Arena, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished , Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history ,5
Hotel Arena, First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all , Comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak English restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast Tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park,0
Hotel Arena, Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms ,,0
Hotel Arena, the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor , The friendly staff in bar restaurant The evening meal was excellent A pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful After the building renovations I think this hotel will be fabulous It has so much history and is so unusual Loved it ,4
Hotel Arena, The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well , The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy ,1
Hotel Arena, There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work , Great room great staff great food ,0
Hotel Arena, Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower , Food in restaurant Quirky place use to be a hospital Reasonably convienent for transport into city centre Beautiful park beside hotel Walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast ,2
Hotel Arena, We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow , Beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move rooms,1
Hotel Arena,, Beautiful gothic hotel Very good location Some nice bars and restaurants Fabulous Thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from Dam centre Really enjoyed staying there There was building work ongoing but you would never have know ,2
Hotel Arena, The fact I had to leave, The whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful,6
Hotel Arena, The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished , Room was lovely we got a free upgrade Bathroom fab Excellent breakfast Nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke Reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice ,0
Hotel Arena, The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating , Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay ,0
Hotel Arena, Currently have building work in the complex This didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive , Very comfortable bed and cool hotel,0
Hotel Arena, Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road , Hotel was very clean and staff helpful Very trendy and reasonably priced,0
Hotel Arena, We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel ,,5
Hotel Arena, The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper , The bed was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase ,5
Hotel Arena, The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning , Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive ,0
Hotel Arena, There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major , The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine ,0
Hotel Arena, More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on , Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room ,3
Hotel Arena, When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste , The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle ,0
Hotel Arena, Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost , Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant ,0
Hotel Arena, Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night , Cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in Amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel And great shower ,5
Hotel Arena,, Bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre Also th bathroom walls are completely see through Wouldn t advise number 2 s if you are sharing a room ,3
Hotel Arena, The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night , The staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice The bed was quite confortable ,1
Hotel Arena, Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly , Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed ,0
Hotel Arena, The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid , The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the hotel sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper Trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport ,3
Hotel Arena, I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel, The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle,0
Hotel Arena, the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise , Bed was nice ,0
Hotel Arena, Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained , Really nice building but lots of building work going off But only outside so not a problem Good size rooms fairly modern Good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram WiFi worked perfectly and quickly ,5
Hotel Arena, The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms, Loved the decor in the hotel and the staff where very helpful and friendly,0
Hotel Arena, The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking, 24 reception Changed rooms immediately after complaint,3
Hotel Arena, Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem , The staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms s good size Nice bathrooms Bar area very comfortable Complimentary drink a nice touch A little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around Plans for development look amazing Would like come back when completed ,3
Hotel Arena, Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired , Cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you,0
Hotel Arena, Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through , The room was exactly as expected The bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was HUGE Easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk ,3
Hotel Arena, The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive , Great hotel and quiet university area Wonderful comfy beds in clean well equipped rooms The food is wonderful ,5
Hotel Arena, The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money , The bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay Very happy with our room for the money that we paid ,3
Hotel Arena,, The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive The room itself was amazing and the bed itself was so comfy we struggled getting up of a morning I would recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
Hotel Arena, Nothing One Of The Receptionist she did a racist comment regarding My accent and my country The housekeeping Didnt like was a disaster Enter in The room Without knock The door a tall girl ,,5
Hotel Arena, Breakfast was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day , Our room was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows Very memorable The hotel is right next to a large nice park Staff was friendly ,0
Hotel Arena, The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu , The rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere Due to building work In progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture ,0
Hotel Arena, Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,,0
Hotel Arena, the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking, The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible,6
Hotel Arena,, The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush ,0
Hotel Arena, The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards , Room service good quality staff,5
Hotel Arena, We didn t have a bad experience , We loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling ,1
Hotel Arena, Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue, Hotel was very modern and location was great Complimentary drinks was a really nice touch ,0
Hotel Arena,, Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend The hotel was perfect A short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel Perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby Staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy We really enjoyed our stay ,0
Hotel Arena, Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it , Staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish ,4
Hotel Arena, They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back, absolutely stunning hotel lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location,0
Hotel Arena, When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts , The bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy It was nice the shower was clean I enjoyed my room Wasn t allowed to check in till 3 but managed to get us a room by 2ish which was good ,0
Hotel Arena, Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting , The room was pleasant We liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable The mini fridge safe tv s with English channels and the ability to make drink were pluses,5
Hotel Arena, The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom , Nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light A lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction ,3
Hotel Arena, The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp , The room is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best I ve ever seen The staff is very kind I would very much recommend this hotel if you don t mind travel 20 min to the center ,3
Hotel Arena, The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion , The room we upgraded to was very nice ,0
Hotel Arena, Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool, Location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel , Polite staff ,5
Hotel Arena, The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult , The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam ,3
Hotel Arena, the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again , nothing,5
Hotel Arena, In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena, Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed,0
Hotel Arena, Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only , Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center ,0
Hotel Arena, Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful , The room was stunning Did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door Will definitely recommend ,6
Hotel Arena, Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel, Very smart room good food ,0
Hotel Arena, No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine , Breakfast Staff,6
Hotel Arena, the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants , staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked ,0
Hotel Arena, The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel , The hall,3
Hotel Arena, Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing , Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction ,5
Hotel Arena,, Staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful hotel the room I stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food And easy trams into central 10 mins I highly recommend ,0
Hotel Arena, Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please , Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar ,3
Hotel Arena,, Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena,6
Hotel Arena, Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive , Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff ,2
Hotel Arena, Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you ,,0
Hotel Arena, The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times , Good Wi fi ,3
Hotel Arena,, Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building ,2
Hotel Arena, At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked , The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received ,5
Hotel Arena, Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc , Character of the hotel was great Location was good,0
Hotel Arena,, Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel ,0
Hotel Arena, The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future , The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great ,5
Hotel Arena, Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,,3
Hotel Arena, next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay, friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins,5
Hotel Arena,, This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly ,6
Hotel Arena, Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am , Great location lovely room,0
Hotel Arena, The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs , Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram ,0
Hotel Arena, The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift , Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms ,0
Hotel Arena,, It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus ,0
Hotel Arena, Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all , The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect ,0
Hotel Arena, No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping, Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction ,2
Hotel Arena, The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice , The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome ,1
Hotel Arena, We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice , We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows ,3
Hotel Arena,, I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable ,0
Hotel Arena, Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done, The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower,3
Hotel Arena,, Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town ,2
Hotel Arena,, We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights Hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes Hotel is situated in a quite area The rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy The staff is very nice and helpful,0
Hotel Arena, Theres nothing we was unhappy with, Really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at 6am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airport,0
Hotel Arena,, The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home ,1
Hotel Arena, The rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it , Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes ,0
Hotel Arena, Our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room 62 was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets , Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food ,1
Hotel Arena, n a, This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible ,0
Hotel Arena,, We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa ,0
Hotel Arena, It s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre , Everything The friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar It was truly pleasant to stay in Hotel Arena,0
Hotel Arena, No bad experiences, Amazing rooms with beautiful view of river Food was delicious particularly the veal croqettes and the salmon Staff are helpful and friendly ,4
Hotel Arena, floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating, staff good location suited us,3

K K Hotel George, The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv , Great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the Earl s Court Underground station Clean Quiet Breakfast was a good quality and selection Nice pillows Lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains Newly remodeled marble slate bathroom Mini fridge in room Desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up Beautiful garden area I didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area ,5

K K Hotel George, Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves , Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom ,0
K K Hotel George, The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company , Very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family The hotel has a inside garden beautiful English style where you feel relax with a glass of beer It s very close to the Earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night We like this hotel ,0

K K Hotel George, We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food , We had gluten free breakfast They had separate toaster for gluten free breads But I can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet Otherwise I can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast I just could not eat it Still for sure I could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast Enough for a big man It was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel ,4

K K Hotel George, Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars , The position of the hotel was very close to Earl s Court Tube Station,0

K K Hotel George,, This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again ,0

K K Hotel George, Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close , Staff Great friendly Acomodating In particular reception staff and bar man Wednesday night You can open a bedroom window,4
K K Hotel George, The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm, Staff were very helpful,1
K K Hotel George, Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place , Very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys Only a short walk to nearest subway Nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms Good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff Nice breakfast restaurant Will come back again ,4
K K Hotel George, Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint , The hotel is incredibly handy to Earl s Court Station We loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet G T at the end of each hectic day in London We ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent Being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu Must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located There was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing We ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well ,4
K K Hotel George, Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin , Excellent location You have the access to Earl s Court Underground within 3 minutes walk District and Piccadilly Lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially Heathrow without any transfer Many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter ,3
K K Hotel George, Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors , House keeping quality and service very good Even folded our clothes Breakfast was unbelievable You even had stewed prunes First floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet Loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks Liked the breakfast being made available with room price Obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also Would consider staying here again ,0
K K Hotel George,, Although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city Breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city ,0
K K Hotel George, Nothing could have been better honestly and I m very critical and picky , I love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street The breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious The rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you The whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive West End hotel but with a cosy feel to it It s my favourite hotel in London and I ve stayed in quite a few ,0
K K Hotel George,, This is the second time I stay in this hotel It s clean and bed is calling my comfortable Also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets,2
K K Hotel George,, close to city center 3mins away from Tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast,2
K K Hotel George, It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again,,6
K K Hotel George, The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same , This hotel was a great value near the tube station in Earl s Court It was one of the few places in London that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter It was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything There was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring ,0
K K Hotel George, Why carp when there is nothing to carp about , Staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service Breakfast buffet is first rate Easy access to rest of London esp Old Brompton Road and Knotting Hill ,4
K K Hotel George, The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did , Location is very useful for Heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight The place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good ,2

K K Hotel George, The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress , The breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated We especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled Great taxi service was provided when requested ,4
K K Hotel George, The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better , The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request ,3
K K Hotel George, Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night , We had a fantastic stay at the K K George Very easy access to Earls Court tube which goes straight to Heathrow as well as being a great start to explore London easily Quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in Room was very comfortable and well serviced Breakfast had lots of choice Really a lovely base for a holiday in London ,2

K K Hotel George, Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident , Convenient location for our purpose Clean and comfortable rooms,5
K K Hotel George, The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did , Staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy ,1

K K Hotel George, Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal , Like the location as I chose it myself Breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable Bed very comfy,3
K K Hotel George, Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel, Everything except the space in the room,0
K K Hotel George, Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink , The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious The staff are polite and helpful ,3
K K Hotel George, Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options , Great selection for breakfast buffet Hotel location great Near Earls Court tube station Loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage Hotel has a bar high is convenient,2

K K Hotel George, Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way , Location is good 2 mins to Earl s Court station Loads of restaurants nearby Tranquil neighbourhood Clean Free printing stable wifi,5

K K Hotel George, The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count , Unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized The location is great which is only 3 munites walk from Earl s Court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around The room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in London It only takes about 40 munites going from Heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in London not very early I will definitely prefer this hotel next time ,3

K K Hotel George, breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme , reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them ,4

K K Hotel George, Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable , Good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station Friendly hotel staff Clean room and bathroom with nice big shower ,5

K K Hotel George, English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice , Lovely hotel with friendly staff Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating We had a room overlooking the garden which was nice Excellent location Would definitely stay here again ,4
K K Hotel George, The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January , The price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in London The location is very good 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court metro station at Piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in London direct from the Heathrow airport And to all the popular locations in London Near the Hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes The hotel very clean modern and new The breakfast very good not too expensive for full English Breakfast 15 per person At any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more The bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean This is my second time I m staying in the k k hotels in Europe they are very good ,0

K K Hotel George, I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home , Location,2
K K Hotel George, Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better, Excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to Earl s Court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the Piccadilly line good breakfast,2
K K Hotel George, Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again , The staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen ,0
K K Hotel George, The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price , Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides,0
K K Hotel George, Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger , Everything a boutique hotel should be Well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to Earls Court station Tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design Really impressive My single room was quite small but well laid out I WILL go back Liked it the best of 30 hotels I ve stayed in London ,0
K K Hotel George, See above tangent , Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away ,0
K K Hotel George, I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again ,,5
K K Hotel George, We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor ,,5
K K Hotel George, Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers, Hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained,4
K K Hotel George, in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources, very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds,1
K K Hotel George, It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride , Staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean ,2
K K Hotel George, 1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm , Bar area and Reception good,3
K K Hotel George,, We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself ,0
K K Hotel George, On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show , On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal ,5
K K Hotel George,, I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This hotel was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice hotel and staff Nice selection of food at breakfast Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court ,2
K K Hotel George, The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny , Room was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated ,3
K K Hotel George, Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good , Location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed ,2
K K Hotel George, Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained , Very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small hotel Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower ,3
K K Hotel George, Parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess, Excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important,2
K K Hotel George, Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall , Location staff and cleanliness ,0
K K Hotel George, Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London , Great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel ,3
K K Hotel George, The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant , Good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom Excellent choice of food at breakfast The bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire ,0

K K Hotel George, The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor , The place is nice and the breakfast is very good It was nice that you could open the windows to air out the room though in all honesty the room really needed that option,3
K K Hotel George, It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so, Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room ,4
K K Hotel George, No bad experiences at all, There was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel Our room was very comfortable and a good size for a London hotel It was clean tidy and well equipped The staff were first class They were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot The breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality We will certainly pay a return visit ,0

K K Hotel George, Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money , Location for us was important Main public areas high standard and parking a bonus,5
K K Hotel George, Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent , Great location great amenities transport links Rooms had all key requirements Staff helpful,4

Apex Temple Court Hotel, The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi , The location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the Underground Tube We also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district There were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice The staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly They also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them ,0

Apex Temple Court Hotel, This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time ,,0
Apex Temple Court Hotel, Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building, The design facilities and location of the hotel WIFI and also Gym were quite convenient,0
